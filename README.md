# Assessment
## This repo contains the assignments that I have done

Inside the AndroidLibrary folder in the Main Branch, the assignment for Library usage is there.

Welcome Greeting Application

The app allows users to login with either Email(with password), or Google account or Phone number.
Once the user is logged in, the user details are shown, and the user is greeted with a random image. On restarting the app, the image changes.

The Libraries used in this app:
Picasso
ViewBinding.

With Picasso, the app is able to parse images over https and also allows caching so that the usage of resources are minimised while the image is being fetched over the internet.

With ViewBinding, the app performance is further improved as this allows to map the widgets to the activities, and it doesn't require to find the views by ID everytime an activity is launched.

The screenshots are attached below:
